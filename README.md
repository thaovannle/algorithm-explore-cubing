(draft for issues)
slow hand movement: need more practice
faster solving, dont rotate the pyraminx, look over from top to find what next piece to solve
sometimes forgot what color are we solving for
slower timing due to when every piece is at the bottom, has to scramble it up again to continue to solve
--"find out" a way: RUR LUL, then continue to solve
i notice when i use one move continuously (eg: >3 RUR or LUL in a row), the problem occurs
have so much trouble figuring out due to watch the tutorial not carefully, maryam actually shows me how
have trouble finding what color to solve first (consistently), mostly blue, sometimes i switch other color and f up
figured out i dont have to match tip pieces back in between solving process, i could put it back later
